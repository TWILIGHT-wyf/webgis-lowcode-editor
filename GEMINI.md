# WebGIS Low-Code Editor Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a **WebGIS Low-Code Editor** project, a platform for building data visualization dashboards with geospatial capabilities. It is structured as a **monorepo** using PNPM workspaces.

The project is currently undergoing a significant architectural refactor (V1.5) to move from a flat component list to a **recursive tree-based structure** with a dedicated rendering engine.

### Key Technologies
*   **Framework:** Vue 3 (Composition API)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Package Manager:** PNPM
*   **State Management:** Pinia
*   **UI Library:** Element Plus
*   **Visualization:** ECharts, Leaflet
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB (in `server/`)

## Architecture & Packages

The project is organized into several packages under the `packages/` directory, scoped under `@vela`:

*   **`packages/editor` (`@vela/editor`)**: The main editor application. Contains the UI, canvas, and logic for the low-code platform.
    *   *Note:* Currently transitioning to V1.5 architecture (see below).
*   **`packages/core` (`@vela/core`)**: The protocol layer. Contains shared types, utilities, and core logic used across packages.
*   **`packages/renderer` (`@vela/renderer`)**: The runtime rendering engine. Responsible for recursively rendering the component tree.
*   **`packages/materials` (`@vela/materials`)**: The component/material library wrapper.
*   **`packages/ui` (`@vela/ui`)**: Shared UI components.
*   **`server` (`webgis-server`)**: The backend service providing AI agent integration and project persistence (MongoDB).

### V1.5 Architecture (Refactoring)
The editor is moving towards a V1.5 architecture characterized by:
*   **Tree Structure:** Components are stored as a recursive tree (`NodeSchema`) instead of a flat array.
*   **Store:** `componentV2.ts` in `packages/editor` manages the tree state.
*   **Recursive Rendering:** Uses `RecursiveRenderer` (from `@vela/renderer`) instead of iterating over a list of shapes.
*   **Component Requirement:** All material components **must** accept a `data-id` attribute and container components must include a `<slot />`.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v20+)
*   PNPM (v8+)
*   MongoDB (Optional, for backend persistence)

### Installation
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Key Commands

| Command | Scope | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm dev` | Root | Starts the frontend editor (`@vela/editor`). |
| `pnpm build` | Root | Builds the frontend editor. |
| `pnpm lint` | Root | Runs ESLint. |
| `pnpm type-check` | Root | Runs TypeScript type checking. |
| `pnpm dev` | `server/` | Starts the backend server (run inside `server/` directory). |

> **Note:** The root `pnpm dev` currently only starts the frontend. To run the full stack, you need to run the server separately in the `server` directory.

### Running Tests
The project contains unit, integration, and E2E tests.
*   **Configuration:** `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts` are in the root.
*   **Execution:** Use `npx vitest` or check for specific test scripts if added.

## Directory Structure Highlights
*   `packages/editor/src/components/Canvas`: V1.5 Canvas implementation.
*   `packages/editor/src/views/EditorV2.vue`: Entry point for the V1.5 editor.
*   `packages/editor/src/stores/componentV2.ts`: New tree-based store.
*   `server/routes/ai.ts`: AI Agent integration logic.
*   `tests/`: Global test suite.

## Coding Conventions
*   **Package Scoping:** Use `pnpm -F <package-name> <command>` to run commands for specific packages.
*   **Imports:** Use workspace aliases (e.g., `@vela/core`) where applicable.
*   **Vue Style:** script setup with Composition API.
